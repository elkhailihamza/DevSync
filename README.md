# DevSync

## Project Overview

**DevSync** is a collaborative task management platform built with **JAKARTA EE**. It features advanced search capabilities using tags, scheduling constraints, and automated status updates. Designed to enhance collaboration and simplify task management, DevSync serves individuals, team leaders, and managers in dynamic work environments.

### Key Features

- **Advanced Tag Search**: Easily find tasks using a tagging system that allows for efficient categorization and retrieval.
- **Scheduling Constraints**: Manage deadlines and dependencies effectively to ensure tasks are completed on time.
- **Automated Status Updates**: Keep team members informed with real-time updates on task progress and changes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design that simplifies task creation, assignment, and tracking.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Facilitate communication and cooperation among team members to enhance productivity.

## Technologies Used

- **JAKARTA EE**: For building enterprise-level applications.
- **Hibernate**: For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and database interactions.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: For data management.
- **CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)**: For managing bean lifecycles and dependencies.
- **JSP (Java Server Pages)**: Used as a front-end.
